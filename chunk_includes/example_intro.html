    <h2>Example</h2>

    In this HIT you will see 65 items like the following, each presenting two pairs of categories:

    <b><i>Be careful: words in this HIT can sometimes refer to multiple categories!</i></b> For instance, "crane" could mean a lifting machine or a type of bird. In this case, we mean the type of bird, and you should answer accordingly.
    <br><br>
    In this example you would probably choose pair 1, because the categories <i>wheel</i> and <i>car</i> seem more closely related than
    the categories <i>building</i> and (the type of bird!) <i>crane</i>.<br><br>
    <b><i>Don't know the meaning of a word?</i></b> Use your mouse to hover over a word to see its definitions.
    <br><br>
    In this HIT, often there will be a clear difference in relatedness between the pairs. Sometimes both pairs will be highly related, or both relatively unrelated -- in these cases always choose the pair that is <i>slightly</i> more related.<br>

    <h2>INFORMATION SHEET AND REQUEST FOR INFORMED CONSENT</h2>

    <b>RESEARCH PROJECT:</b> AMORE: A distributional MOdel of Reference to Entities (Universitat Pompeu Fabra –
    Barcelona – SPAIN).<br>
    <b>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:</b> Gemma Boleda.<br>
    <b>FINANCED BY:</b> European Research Council (European Union).<br>
    <b>SURVEY CARRIED OUT WITH THE COLLABORATION OF:</b> Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)<br>

    <h3>PART 1. INFORMATION SHEET</h3>

    <h3>Purpose of the research</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The research aims at collecting human judgments of category relatedness, to see how well different computational models of categories align with humans, with the aim of coming to a better understanding of how people use language, with the possible long term goal of improving
            human-computer communication.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure description</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You will be presented with around 100 items. Each item consists of two pairs of categories. In each item you
            have to choose the pair of categories that are more related to each other.
        </li>
        <li>This HIT contains control items to monitor the quality of your work. We reserve the right to block the
            participation in the project if your answers to these control items are unsatisfactory, e.g., evidence of
            random answering; in this case, you will not be reimbursed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Privacy and data handling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your AMT WorkerID, together with the category relatedness judgments you produce during this experiment, will
            be available to the researchers of the AMORE project, who have committed to handling it in an anonymous and
            confidential manner. These data will be stored in UPF, Barcelona (Spain), and will be retained during the
            life of the project (up to 31 January 2022) and for five years afterwards for auditing purposes. If you wish
            your data to be removed, such that they cannot be used for the project, please get in touch with Gemma
            Boleda (gemma.boleda@upf.edu), specifying your AMT WorkerID.
        </li>
        <li>The data we collect, in an anonymized form, will be uploaded onto the UPF repository
            (https://repositori.upf.edu) and on the project’s web site (https://www.upf.edu/web/amore) webpage to be
            consulted and used in other projects by other researchers worldwide, and shared with collaborators.
        </li>
        <li>Research results will be published in journal articles, conference presentations and via any other mode of
            scientific exchange and dissemination that will be seen as appropriate by the researchers, always protecting
            the participants' anonymity.
        </li>
        <li>By accepting to participate in this survey you hereby grant UPF an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive,
            transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to reproduce, distribute,
            publicly perform or display and transform your task results such that they can be used in this research
            project and they can be made available through the project’s webpage and the e-repository, such that they
            can be reused worldwide.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Voluntary participation and freedom to withdraw from the research</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your choice to take part in the research is entirely voluntary. You are completely free to choose not to
            participate, or to withdraw from the study at any moment without any consequence.
        </li>
        <li>This study was evaluated and approved by Parc de Salut MAR - Clinical Research Ethical Committee of UPF.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Potential risk and discomfort</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If, at any time, you should become tired or feel other forms of discomfort, you can simply quit the survey.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For participating in this HIT, you will receive a monetary compensation of 1.50$. Furthermore, your participation will enable research on how we use language to talk about the world.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Potential reuse of the data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Only the task results, in an anonymized way, will be consulted and used in other projects by other
            researchers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions? Write to us!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For any further doubt or clarification request, do not hesitate to ask! You can contact the principal
            investigator, Gemma Boleda, by sending an email to the address gemma.boleda@upf.edu.
