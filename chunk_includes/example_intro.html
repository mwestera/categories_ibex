        This HIT is about whether various words are <i>related</i> to each other in meaning.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Example:</b>
        <ol>
          <li> <i>wheels</i> &#8596; <i>car</i>: these words are closely related, because cars have wheels.</li>
          <li> <i>queen</i> &#8596; <i>crane</i>: these words are <i>not</i> closely related.</li>
        </ol>
        When comparing pair 1 vs. pair 2, you would say that pair 1 is more closely related than pair 2.
    </p>

    <p>In this HIT you will see around 50 comparisons like this. Every time you have to <b>choose the pair of words that are more closely related to each other</b>.</p>

    <br>

    <p>
        Sometimes both pairs contain words related in meaning. In such cases you have to pick the pair with the more strongly related words.</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b>
        <ul>
          <li> <i>wheels</i> &#8596; <i>car</i> vs. <i>dog</i> &#8596; <i>race</i>: the first pair should be preferred as every car has wheels but not every dog is involved in a race.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>It is also possible that neither pair contains closely related words. Then you have to pick the pair that contains at least slightly more related words.</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <i>cup</i> &#8596; <i>asphalt</i> vs. <i>auction</i> &#8596; <i>car</i>: the second pair should be picked because at least fancy vintage cars can be sold at auctions.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
